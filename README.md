## Python Web Mapping Practice with Folium

In this exercise, I've used Folium to render an HTML file containing an interactive world map.

In the code, I have imported data on volcanoes throughout the USA territory and assigned their location, name and elevation figures on the map.

Also, I've added population data from countries across the world and and assigned color to them based on the population figure.
